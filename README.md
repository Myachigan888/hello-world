# hello-world
# I am a resident of Russia, in particular the city of Moscow. And know, the whole world, we, Russian not animals. We, simply, many generations are kept in slavery, lies, persecution and poverty. I want these lines to reach my grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Know we are a brotherly people, but with pigs, bessies, devils and captured. All good people
